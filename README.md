## 📖 About the Project

**SINET GP Architect** is a *Single-Page Application* (SPA) built on the **Local-First** philosophy. It does not send your data to external servers. Everything is stored locally in your browser (`localStorage`), ensuring 100% privacy and offline capability.

The goal is to introduce **engineering discipline** into AI prompting by implementing the **"5 Elements"** methodology (Task, Context, Format, Tone, Example).

## 🚀 Key Features

* **🛡️ Local-First Architecture:** All data (Gems, Prompts, Settings, Audit) resides in your browser. Zero cloud dependency.
* **💎 Gems & Prompts Databases:** Separate management for structured instructions (Gems) and raw code (Prompts).
* **🧙‍♂️ 5-Elements Wizard:** Built-in form that guides you to define **Task, Context, Format, Example, and Tone** for every prompt.
* **🔄 Converter Lab:** Bi-directional conversion (Raw Prompt ↔ Structured Gem) with HTML/JS parsing capabilities.
* **⚡ Generator Lab (Stress Test):** Algorithmic generation of 1000+ realistic datasets to test system stability.
* **📠 Smart Export & Print:**
    * PDF generation with automated *Time-Stamp* naming convention.
    * Export to `.md` (Markdown) with professional footers.
    * **QR Code Generator** for instant mobile transfer.
* **🔐 Security & Integrity:**
    * **Audit Log:** A "Black Box" recording every user action (Create, Delete, Export).
    * **Backup & Restore:** Full JSON export/import of the entire system.
    * **Hard Reset:** Factory reset option.
* **🆔 Professional Signature:** Automatically appends your Name, Role (SysAdmin), GitHub profile, and contact info to every exported document.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Core:** HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+).
* **UI Framework:** Bootstrap 5.3 (Responsive / Mobile-First).
* **Icons:** FontAwesome 6.
* **Libraries:** `qrcode.js` (for QR code generation).
* **Storage:** Browser LocalStorage API.
